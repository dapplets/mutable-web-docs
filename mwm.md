# MWM - the Mutable Web Manifesto

Web3 needs a new decentralized UI/UX layer.  
The flaw of the current paradigm is in the website owner's ability to control what the community can see, say, and use. The current Web3 paradigm hopes to solve the problem by making the owner resilient, decentralized, and inclusive. It changes nothing in the owner's ability to control the user experience and, thereby, the community. Still, in the end, it only makes the owner's role even more resilient and powerful in the hope of his benevolence. We need to find a new balance of power between the owner and the user community. No matter who the owner is.

Currently, the user agent (the browser) displays the website exactly as specified by the owner. The website owner can reject any request from the community and enforce any change. This monopoly over the UX layer is the root cause of the owner's power. However, the browser runs on the user's computer and under his physical control. Therefore, the user always has the power to customize the UX and share it within the community. It is what the Mutable Web is for.

Mutable Web is a new user-centric web paradigm where every sub-community can customize the website to fit their specific needs and, at the same time, stay in the whole community. Communities become self-sovereign and resilient, can earn their own money, and set their own rules. No owner can enforce rules against the community will in the long term anymore. Website owners can now focus on the main functionality and don't need to bother with the feature requests - communities will take care of themselves. Mutable Web is the future of web3 we are building.
